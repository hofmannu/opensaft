# Hardware

Optoacoustic imaging consists out of several important key components which will be listed in this document. 

## Light sources

- nanosecond pulsed laser sources
- typically narrow band
- multispectral options available through dye lasers, OPOs, and supercontinuum lasers
- trend towards laser diodes as a cheap alternative, biggest challenge at the moment is achievable power

## Ultrasound transducers

- largely vary in frequency response
- ideally broadband for high resolution
- microscopy reaches up to 100 MHz, tomography typically 1-10 MHz
